  TODO: support preprocessor

TODO: make the compiler support both 32 bit and 64 bit asm?

- NOTE: the only external resource I refer is the grammar of C language
- NOTE: use stack to store temporary right now. Need implement advanced register allocation algorithms
- TODO: let the make file support dependency on header file

NOTE: we can try to compile mongoose/memcached with my compiler :)

need distinguish declarator and abstract_declarator <== parse these 2 at the same time

Compiler optimization
1. copy duplication

========== DONE
- translate sample.c back to C
- translate sample.c to asm (32 bit)
- support for, while
- a simple integration test framework
