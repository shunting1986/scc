	TODO: support multip-dimen array, matrix multi <==

KEYLIST
	TODO: support pointer..

	TODO: type system; I'd better extract the pure type out of syntax tree
	TODO: typedef
	TODO: auto add ret instruction
	TODO: type conversion?
	TODO: switch, struct def & dot & ptr, general pointer, break, continue
  TODO: support preprocessor
	TODO: support initializer

- NOTE: the only external resource I refer is the grammar of C language
- TODO: let the make file support dependency on header file

NOTE: we can try to compile mongoose/memcached/ITSELF!! with my compiler :)

need distinguish declarator and abstract_declarator <== parse these 2 at the same time


=========== EXTRA

Compiler optimization
1. copy duplication

TODO: n-queen (the code is about 3 times slower than the one generated by GCC. I'd like to optimize the compiler :))
TODO: how to reclaim the memory for 'type' object
TODO: analyze memleak
TODO: use stack to store temporary right now. Need implement advanced register allocation algorithms
TODO: make the compiler support both 32 bit and 64 bit asm?

========== DONE
- translate sample.c back to C
- translate sample.c to asm (32 bit)
- support for, while, if, (recursive) function call, && || short cut, global variable, one dim array
- support insertion sort, bubble sort, nqueen
- a simple integration test framework
